finding donors for charityML using Supervised Learning  
# Project Overview
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. First explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Then evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, optimize the model that is selected and present it as a solution to CharityML. Finally, explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
